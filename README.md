JBoss BRMS Weightwatcher Realtime Decision Server Demo
======================================================
This demo project is a demonstration application of a stateless Realtime Decision Server based on JBoss BRMS 
and includes support for complex event processing (CEP) use cases based on a pseudo clock.  

Examples provided include a (REST) client sending a time series of facts in the form of weight observations 
to the deployed Realtime Decision Server. The Realtime Decision Server then reasons over the inputs to derive 
CEP insights such as average weight, least weight and weight change of a rolling time window. These insights 
are returned to the calling client as facts.


Option 1 - Install on local machine
------------------------
1. [Download and unzip.](https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/brms-weightwatcher-realtime-decision-server-demo/archive/master.zip)

2. Add products to installs directory.

3. Run 'init.sh' or 'init.bat' file. 'init.bat' must be run with Administrative privileges.

4. Start JBoss BRMS Server by running ./target/jboss-eap-6.4/bin/standalone.sh

5. Login to http://localhost:8080/business-central

    ```
    - login for admin and analyst roles (u:erics / p:jbossbrms1!)
    ```

6. Build and deploy version 1.0 of project, verify at 'Authoring -> Artifact repository' to see deployed weightwatchers-1.0.jar artifact.

7. Open rule deployments perspective via menu Deploy -> Rules Deployments

8. Register a new server by filling in pop-up:

  - Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/
  
  - Name: DevServer (...as we are testing this in our dev environment)

  - Username: erics (...who must have role of kie-server)

  - Password: jbossbrms1!

9. Provision starts by creating a Container, click on DevServer '+' on right.

  - Name: container-weightwatchers1.0

  - search button gathers all artifacts available, SELECT weightwatchers-1.0 to auto-fill rest of fields

  - click on OK

10. Container is created, click on icon far right to view details.

11. Select container-weightwatchers1.0 and click START to get it up and running, was orange color next to name, should turn green.

12. See 'Resolved Release Id' section for the container and version that is running and ready for rule queries.

13. Using Firefox + RESTClient you can see which server containers are available by:

   - Add auth credentials in menu Authentication - Basic Authentication:  Username: erics    Password: jbossbrms1!

   - Method: GET

   - URL: http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers

   - it will show container = contianer-weightwatchers1.0, meaning our container is available via the provided RestAPI 

14. You can view some more information provided by the RestAPI using GET methods:

   - http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/container-weightwatchers1.0

15. Now to use POST or PUT methods we need to add a header to RESTClient for our requests:

   - in menu Headers -> Custom Header

   - Name: Content-Type

   - Value: application/xml

16. Query the Realtime Decision Server with loan rules by using POST method:

   - http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/container-weightwatchers1.0

   - body of message can be found in support/weightwatchers-query.xml file, copy into Body section of RESTClient.

17. For creation or deletion of containers in the RestAPI, you need to use PUT methods, see product documentation User Guide for
		details.


Option 2 - Generate containerized install
-----------------------------------------
The following steps can be used to configure and run the demo in a container

1. [Download and unzip.](https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/brms-weightwatcher-realtime-decision-server-demo/archive/master.zip)

2. Add product installer to installs directory.

3. Copy contents of support/docker directory to the project root.

4. Build demo image.

	```
	docker build -t jbossdemocentral/brms-weightwatcher-realtime-decision-server-demo .
	```
5. Start demo container.

	```
	docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 jbossdemocentral/brms-weightwatcher-realtime-decision-server-demo
	```
6. Follow instructions from above starting at step 5 replacing *localhost* with *&lt;RH_CONTAINER_HOST&gt;* when applicable

Additional information can be found in the jbossdemocentral container [developer repository](https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/docker-developer)


Notes
-----
You will need some sort of Rest client, such as the RESTClient Firefox extension which is used in this demo (screenshots and
videos). After installing RESTClient in Firefox, restart and open it under TOOLS menu.
